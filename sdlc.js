// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

//Planning
//Analysis of Requirements
//Design
//Implementation
//Testing & Integration
//Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisStep = "Involves gathering and analyzing information about the system to be developed. This includes understanding user needs, constraints, and functional requirements."

const designStep = "The phase where system architecture, database design, and software design are planned. It serves as a blueprint for the actual coding process."

const implementationStep = "The stage where the actual coding of the software takes place. Developers write the code according to the specifications outlined in the design phase."

const testingIntegrationStep = "Involves testing individual components and integrating them to ensure that the software functions as intended. It includes unit testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing."

const maintainStep = "The ongoing phase where the software is regularly updated, improved, and adapted to changing requirements. It includes bug fixes, feature enhancements, and overall system maintenance."
